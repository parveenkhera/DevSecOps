DevSecOps is a software development methodology that integrates security into the development process. The objective of DevSecOps is to build security into the design, development, and operation of software applications, rather than treating it as an afterthought or a separate phase of development.

There are several key objectives of DevSecOps:

To improve the security of software applications: By integrating security into the development process, DevSecOps aims to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities early in the development process, before they can be exploited.

To increase the speed and efficiency of software development: By automating security testing and integrating it into the development process, DevSecOps helps teams to identify and fix security issues faster, which can reduce the time it takes to develop and release new software.

To improve collaboration between development and security teams: DevSecOps promotes close collaboration between development and security teams, helping them to work together to identify and address security issues.

To reduce the risk of security breaches: By building security into the development process, DevSecOps aims to reduce the risk of security breaches, protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of software applications.
